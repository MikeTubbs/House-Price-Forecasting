# House Price Forecasting and Portfolio Optimization

Here you will find three jupyter notebooks that are orgainzed into three parts:
  1) Data Pull - This pulls data in from FRED for house prices, wages, permits, mortgage rates and housing supply
  2) Forecast - This uses a VECM to demonstrate how the forecasts and analysis are done in simplified form on San Francisco and then creates forecasts for all available MSAs we have data
  3) Portfolio Optimization - This code then takes those forecasts and integrates them into a mean variance optimiaztion framework like in quantiitative finance and generates sample portfolios using historical data, and computes allocations of example portfolios and some plots

The aim of this project is to explore the tools of financial and macro forecasting as well as those of modern portfolio theory through an alternative lens. This could be used to originate homes for SMAs in SFR or many other contexts.
